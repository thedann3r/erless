Using React + TailwindCSS + React Router DOM, rebuild the UI for the Erlessed healthcare claims platform with the following structure:

‚ú® General Design:
- Brand color: Teal (#14B8A6) and healthcare blue (#3B82F6)
- Use a modern, clean layout with minimal shadows, rounded 2xl borders, and responsive grid-based design
- Font: 'Inter' or 'Open Sans'
- Shadcn/UI components preferred for consistency
- Add a top-right logout button to all dashboards
- Avoid using terms like ‚ÄúAI‚Äù in buttons or tabs, even if AI-powered

üîê Login/Signup:
- Login accepts either email or username
- On signup:
  - Clinical users provide regulator info (e.g. PPB, KMPDC)
  - Non-clinical users skip this step
  - Signup does NOT allow new provider/insurer creation (admin-only)
