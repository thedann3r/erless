Design a "Debtors Dashboard" for the accounts team to audit, organize, and submit verified claims in Erlessed. Debtors do not perform fingerprint/OTP verification but only review claims that have passed biometric verification.

🧭 Layout Structure:
- Header: “Debtors Panel”, date selector, Erlessed logo, logout dropdown
- Sidebar:
  - Claim Batches
  - Diagnosis Audit
  - Void Claims (Premium Only)
  - Reimbursement Tracker
  - Submission Queue
  - Settings

📊 Top Summary Cards:
- Verified Claims (Today)
- Pending Diagnosis
- Expected Reimbursement (KES)
- Rejected Claims (Last 30 days)
- % Void Claims (if premium)

🗂️ Key Features in Main View:

1. **Verified Claims Table**
   - Show only claims with completed fingerprint/OTP verification
   - Columns: Patient, Date, Services, Amount, Diagnosis Status, Fingerprint Status ✅
   - Filter by provider, scheme, service type, and claim status
   - Add batch selector checkboxes

2. **Audit Trail Viewer**
   - Click a claim to open full audit log: who verified (name, role), timestamp, terminal used
   - Show biometric verification hash (for blockchain logging if enabled)

3. **Diagnosis Audit Panel**
   - Identify claims with missing/uncoded diagnosis
   - Send reminders to clinicians (only in Premium)
   - Show last consultation timestamp vs. billing timestamp

4. **Void Claims Overview** (Premium Feature)
   - Display logic-invalid or expired claims
   - Sort by reason: missing data, time lapse, service mismatch

5. **Submission Queue Builder**
   - Create claim batches for export
   - Buttons: “Add to Batch”, “Mark as Ready”, “Generate NHIF/SHA or CIC Claim PDF”
   - Match batch to scheme (e.g., CIC outpatient, Minet inpatient)

6. **Insurer Response Tracker**
   - Upload response files (PDF/Excel) for reconciliation
   - Highlight: Fully Paid, Partially Paid, Denied (reason tooltip)
   - Buttons: “Flag for Resubmission”, “Mark Reconciled”

🧠 System Logic:
- Claims must show `biometric_verified = true` in DB before they appear here
- Debtors have read-only access to verification and prescription logs
- All printed claim forms (insurer-specific) are already prefilled upon biometric check

🎨 Styling:
- Verified icon (🟢) next to each claim with timestamp
- Use tabs or accordion UI to group claims by insurer
- Highlight overdue claims (older than 21 days) in orange

🔐 Premium-only notices:
- Display greyed-out blocks for premium sections (e.g., “Void Claim Filters — Premium Feature”)
